\subsection{Fast Retransmit}

A host may send multiple packets in quick succession, one or more
of these packets may be lost. Upon receiving a packet, the receiver
will reply with an ACK.\ If the sequence number of the incoming packet
is not what the receiver expected, it will reply with the same ACK
as the last packet which was correctly in sequence.

If the sender receives \textit{three duplicate acknowledgements}
in a row, it will retransmit from the smallest sequence number which
has not yet been ACKed.

This might all occur \textit{before} a timeout occurs for the lost
packet. The receipt of three duplicate ACKs indicates to the sender
that a packet has been lost, and it does not need to wait for the
timeout to confirm loss.
