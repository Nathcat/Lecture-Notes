\subsubsection{Congestion Control methods}

\textit{End-to-end}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inferred by hosts from observed loss and delay.
    \item Used by TCP.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Network assisted}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Routers provide direct feedback to hosts.
    \item Either indicate congestion level or explicitly set bit rate.
    \item Used by TCP ECN, ATM, DECbit.
\end{itemize}
