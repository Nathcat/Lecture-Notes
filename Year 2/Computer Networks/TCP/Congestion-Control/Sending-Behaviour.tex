\subsubsection{Sending Behaviour}

A sender has a \textit{Congestion Window (cwnd)}. The cwnd is defined
as the bytes starting from the first unACKed byte, to the last availale byte
(a set of these may already be in-flight but unACKed).

The sender will send all the bytes within its' cwnd, wait RTT for ACKs, update the cwnd, and start again.

\begin{equation}
    rate \approx \frac{cwnd}{RTT}bytes / second
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{last byte sent} - \textrm{last byte acked} \leq cwnd
\end{equation}

The cwnd is adjusted based on the observed congestion, thus limiting the rate
at which the sender sends packets.
