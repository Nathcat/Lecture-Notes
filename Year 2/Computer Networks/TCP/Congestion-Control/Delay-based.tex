\subsubsection{Delay-based Congestion Control}

This approach aims to keep the bottleneck link busy, but not full,
thus avoiding high delay times and buffering.

$RTT_{min}=\textrm{The minimum observed RTT (uncongested path).}$

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \textrm{Uncongested throughput }\lambda_+ &= \frac{cwnd}{RTT_{min}} \\
        \textrm{Measured throughput }\lambda_{act} &= \frac{\textrm{\# of bytes sent}}{RTT_{measured}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

If $\lambda_{act}$ is close to $\lambda_+$, then $cwnd+\beta$, otherwise if $\lambda_{act}$ is far below $\lambda_+$, then $cwnd-\beta$.
Where $\beta$ is some predefined constant.

This method controls congestion without forcing / inducing a loss event, and maximises throughput with minimal delays.
