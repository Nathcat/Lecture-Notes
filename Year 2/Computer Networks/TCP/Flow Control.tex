\subsection{Flow Control}

A receiving host should set the \textit{receive window}
field of its ACK replies to advertise its free buffer space.

The sender should then limit its' sending rate to the receiver's
stated \textit{receive window (rwnd)}.

This solves the issue in which the Network layer delivers packets faster
than the application layer can process them, thus filling
the receiver buffer, leading to packet loss.
