\subsubsection{Costs of Congestion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Throughput never exceeds network capacity.
    \item Delay increases as capacity approached.
    \item Loss and Retransmission decreases effective throughput.
    \item Un-needed duplicates further decrease effective throughput.
    \item Upstream capacity is wasted when packets are lost downstream.
\end{itemize}
