\subsubsection{CUBIC}

Alternative approach to increasing rate from AIMD.

$W_{max}=\textrm{Rate at which last congestion loss occurred}$.

The rate $W$ is increased by a cubic function dependent on the current time, $T$, and the time when $W$ should equal $W_{max}$, $K$:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta W = (T-K)^3
\end{equation}
