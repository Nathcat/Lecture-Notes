\subsection{Implicit threading}

This strategy allows the creation and management of threads
to be done by compilers and run-time libraries rather than the programmers.
This reduces the complexity of the programs written by the programmer.
Which is very helpful as program complexity and the number of threads per program
increases.


\subsubsection{Thread pools}

Several threads are created and await work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does not require new threads to be created upon every service request (recycling threads reduces overhead).
    \item \# of threads in application is fixed to the size of the pool.
    \item The task to perform and the mechanics of creating the task can be separated, allowing for different strategies of running the task.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Fork-Join}

Multiple threads are forked from a single point, complete different tasks, and then rejoin to the main thread of execution.
