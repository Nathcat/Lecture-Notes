\subsection{Scheduling}

A Scheduler aims to maximise CPU usage time.

It maintains two main queues of processes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ready queue --- Queue of processes ready for execution, and waiting for a processor.
    \item Wait queues --- Queues of processes waiting for events. There may be multiple queues, one for each event.\ i.e.\ a queue for processes waiting for child termination, a queue for processes waiting for I/O completion, etc\ldots
\end{itemize}
