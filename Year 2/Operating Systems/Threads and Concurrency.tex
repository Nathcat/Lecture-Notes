\section{Threads and Concurrency}

Threads run inside of a process. They are easier to create than processes,
and thus have a lower overhead.

Thread switching has a much lower overhead than context switching, 
threads are able to share resources, they allow individual processes
to take advantage of a multicore architecture, and allow continued
execution when other parts of the process are blocked.
