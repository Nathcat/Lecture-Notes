\subsection{Scheduling Criteria}

A scheduling algorithm aims for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $max(\textrm{CPU utilisation})$
    \item $max(\textrm{Throughput})$ --- The \# of processes that terminate every time unit.
    \item $min(\textrm{Turnaround time})$ --- The amount of time to execute a program to completion.
    \item $min(\textrm{Waiting time})$ --- Amount of time process is in ready queue.
    \item $min(\textrm{Response time})$ --- Amount of time taken for a request to yield a response.
\end{itemize}
