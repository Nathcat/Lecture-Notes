\subsection{Synchronisation at Hardware level}

Synchronisation is implemented at the hardware level using two concepts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware instructions which ensure synchronisation.
    \item Atomic variables
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test and set --- Tests and modifies a word atomically, and uninterruptedly.
    \item Compare and swap --- Swap two words atomically and uninterrupedly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Atomic variables}

These provide uninterruptable and atomic updates on basic data types, and are implemented using the
aforementioned hardware instructions.
