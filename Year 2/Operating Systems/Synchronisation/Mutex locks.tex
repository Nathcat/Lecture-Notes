\subsection{Mutex locks}

Mutex locks are a simpler way of implementing synchronisation. They are simply
a boolean value indicating if something can be locked.

The CS of a process then is protected with the $acquire$ and $release$ operations. This approach
however does require busy waiting, and therefore the lock is referred to as a \textit{Spinlock}.
