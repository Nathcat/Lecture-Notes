\subsection{Multithreading Models}

\subsubsection{Many-to-one}

Many user threads $\to$ Single kernel thread.

\begin{itemize}
    \item One thread blocking causes all others to be blocked.
    \item Mutiple threads may not run in parallel on multicore systems as only one in the kernel.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{One-to-one}

One user thread $\to$ One kernel thread

Kernel threads are created with user threads.

\begin{itemize}
    \item More concurrency than Many-to-one.
    \item \# of threads per process sometimes limited due to overhead.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Many-to-many}

Many user threads $\to$ Many kernel threads.

Allows the OS to create enough kernel threads.
