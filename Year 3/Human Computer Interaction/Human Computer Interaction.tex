\subsection{Assessment}
The module's grade will be determined by an MCQ in January. There will also be a formative coursework, which is due in week 9.

The coursework is a design and evaluation project, culminating in the delivery of a portfolio, and a presentation to take place in
either week 10 or 11. It can be completed individually, or as part of a group.

We will be given design briefs which come from real companies, detailing a problem to be solved. Canvas has these design briefs, and an
assessment guidelines document.
